### **GRASP Pattern: Indirection**

In the system, the **AuthController** is responsible for handling incoming authentication requests. Rather than directly accessing the database, it delegates the task to a **Service** layer. The **Service** then interacts with the **Repository** to fetch or manipulate data from the database. This implementation follows the **Indirection** principle of GRASP, which suggests that responsibilities should be assigned to intermediate objects when direct assignment creates tight coupling or violates separation of concerns.

- **Why Indirection?**
  - **Decouples** components: The **Controller** doesn't need to know the internal details of how data is fetched or how business logic is processed. It simply delegates tasks to the **Service**.
  - **Separation of Concerns**: The **AuthController** is only responsible for processing HTTP requests and responses, while the **Service** layer handles the application logic, and the **Repository** focuses on interacting with the database.
  - **Maintainability**: Changes to business logic (in the **Service** layer) or database access (in the **Repository**) do not require changes to the **Controller**, making the code more maintainable and adaptable.
  - **Testability**: By isolating the database access into the **Repository** and the business logic into the **Service**, unit testing becomes easier. Mocking the **Service** and **Repository** is straightforward for testing the **AuthController**.
  - **Flexibility**: Future changes, like adding new authentication methods or changing the database, can be done within the **Service** or **Repository** without affecting the **AuthController**.

This design improves code modularity, reusability, and allows for easier refactoring in the future, making the system more scalable and robust.



## **Backend Features**

The backend of the POS system is built with **Spring Boot** and serves as the backbone of the application, managing all the business logic, data storage, and API endpoints. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

### 1. **Order Management**
- Create, update, and delete orders via RESTful APIs.
- Handle payment processing and order status updates.

### 2. **Inventory Management**
- Manage product inventory, including stock levels, product categories, and pricing.
- Track inventory changes in real-time to ensure accurate stock counts.

### 3. **Customer Management**
- Store and retrieve customer data for tracking purchase history.
- Provide APIs for customer-related operations like profile updates and history retrieval.

### 4. **Analytics**
- Aggregate data for reporting, such as sales trends and inventory turnover.
- Provide endpoints for the frontend to fetch chart and report data.

### 5. **Security**
- Use Spring Security to implement role-based authentication and authorization.
- Secure sensitive endpoints and ensure data integrity.
